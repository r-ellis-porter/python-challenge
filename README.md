# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll Analysis

## Overview/Purpose

The Python Challenge comprises two real-world scenarios: PyBank and PyPoll. In PyBank, the objective is to analyze financial records to calculate various metrics such as total months, net total amount of profits/losses, average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits. PyPoll, on the other hand, involves modernizing a vote-counting process by analyzing poll data to determine the total number of votes cast, list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Important Findings

### PyBank Analysis
- **Total Months:** 86
- **Total:** $22,564,198
- **Average Change:** -$8,311.11
- **Greatest Increase in Profits:** Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
- **Greatest Decrease in Profits:** Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)

### PyPoll Analysis
- **Total Votes:** 369,711
- **Candidates and Percentage of Votes:**
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85,213 votes)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272,892 votes)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11,606 votes)
- **Winner:** Diana DeGette

## Summary

The Python Challenge involved analyzing financial and poll data using Python scripting. For PyBank, financial records were examined to calculate key metrics such as total months, net total amount of profits/losses, average change, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits. PyPoll focused on analyzing poll data to determine the total number of votes cast, percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote. Both scripts provided detailed analysis printed to the terminal and exported as text files.

## Technical Details

To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository named `python-challenge`.
2. Navigate to the PyBank folder and run the `main.py` script to analyze financial records.
3. Navigate to the PyPoll folder and run the `main.py` script to analyze poll data.
4. Ensure that the correct path to the CSV files (`budget_data.csv` for PyBank and `election_data.csv` for PyPoll) is provided within the scripts.
5. Review the generated analysis results printed to the terminal and exported as text files in the `analysis` folder.
