# python-challenge

This Python script was written by me based on the material we covered in class and my askBCS session with CJ Campbell.

This repository has two projects: PyBank and PyPoll. 

PyBank's Python script analyses a company's financial records given a .csv dataset with two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates, prints, and exports a .txt file containing the total number on months, net total profits and losses, average monthly change in profits and losses, greatest increase in profits date and amount, and greatest decrease in profits date and amount. 

PyPoll's Python script analyses a small towns election dataset given a .csv with three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The script calculates, prints, and exports a .txt file containing the total number of votes cast, each candidate's "name, percentage won, total votes won", and the election winner by popular vote.
